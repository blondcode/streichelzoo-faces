= Streichelzoo-Faces: Starter Kit for Development of Maven/Foundation/JSF2.2 based Webapps

Disclaimer: This is work in progress.

This project is a Maven based starter kit for development of Java Server Faces JSF2.2
web applications. These can be deployed on Java EE containers such as Wildfly, which
scale from small systems to large sites.
The project provides a design pattern across multiple Maven modules, which combines
front- and backends. For example, these modules may be adapted to some corporate
design and redistributed to some corporate Maven repository. Then they could act 
as archetypes for rapid creation of additional corporate design specific applications.

The current implementation integrates Zurb Foundation for Sites 6 and Asciidoc
with the frontend. Themes and site specific items like icons can be
stored an theme module archetypes. The application itself gets into a prototype
webapp archetype.

= How it works

Download the Github project and run Maven install. This will then download all needed
external Sass and JS dependencies like Foundation for Sites 6, jQuery using
node and bower. It also downloads some preselected fonts. All this gets wrapped up 
in a Sass source Maven jars and stored in the local Maven repository.
The logical project structure:

----
streichelzoo-faces
`-- streichelzoo-site-webapp
    |-- streichelzoo-faces-theme
    |   |-- streichelzoo-sass-foundation
    |   `-- streichelzoo-sass-asciidoc
    |-- streichelzoo-fonts-iconic
    `-- streichelzoo-fonts-misc
----

The theme module depends on Sass source maven modules.
Maven install compiles the Sass sources using gulp and provides a theme jar module,
which is ready for use by the webapp. Furthermore, it creates a archetype,
which it also stores in the repository. This allows for easy adaption of themes without
having to bother with all underlying libraries.

The same applies for the webapp jar. It also gets stored in the repository, along
with its webapp archetype.

And finally, for prototyping themes and creating stylish web pages, there is no need
to create and assemble a war file during development. The webapp maven project
provides an embedded Jetty web server, pages get served locally and can be viewed 
at http://localhost:8888[] per local browser. And Sass files in the theme module 
can be modified on the fly, a Maven watcher plugin looks for changes and autocompiles scss
to css. Simply reload the browser to see the result.

Once all is ready, a war file can be created and deployed into a production
server. And the project itself can be turned into an archetype and stored in
a local or corporate repository, so others can reuse this knowledge.


== Setup

Make sure Maven 3.1.0 or higher is installed, see note below how to install this
on a Debian Jessie system.  Download the project:

 git clone https://github.com/skaterkamp/streichelzoo-faces.git

To create the project, run:

 cd streichelzoo-faces
 mvn install

This downloads every dependency needed and installs all jars above in the local
repository (++$HOME/.m2/++) plus 2 archetypes:

* streichelzoo-faces-theme-archetype
* streichelzoo-site-webapp-archetype

These archetypes contain a starter JSF2.2 webapp with a style and JavaScript framework
packaged as separate modules. This way, multiple web applications may share the
same framework. In case of updates, for example a new Foundation for Sites version,
the streichelzoo-sass-foundation module simply needs to be cleaned and reinstalled,
and the theme needs to be recompiled, and the resulting war file redeployed.

== Web Page Development Example

Suppose we want to create a common theme for site _example.com_, which is mapped to 
virtual host _default-host_.  The context root is _/foo_. (See ++jboss-web.xml++ for 
Wildfly and ++pom.xml++ contextPath for Jetty.) The current streichelzoo-faces
version is _0.94_ and the resulting webapp shall have version
_1.0-SNAPSHOT_. Then, open a shell window and execute these commands:

----
cd $HOME
mkdir example-site
rm -r example-site/*
cd example-site

szversion=0.95-SNAPSHOT

mvn archetype:generate -B \
 -DarchetypeGroupId=de.katerkamp.streichelzoo \
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=streichelzoo-faces-theme-archetype \
 -DarchetypeVersion=$szversion \
 -DgroupId=com.example.site \
 -DartifactId=example-site-theme \
 -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
 -Dpackage=com.example.site

mvn archetype:generate -B \
 -DarchetypeGroupId=de.katerkamp.streichelzoo \
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=streichelzoo-site-webapp-archetype \
 -DarchetypeVersion=$szversion \
 -DgroupId=com.example.site \
 -DartifactId=example-site-foo-webapp \
 -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
 -Dpackage=com.example.site \
 -DthemeGroupId=com.example.site \
 -DthemeArtifactId=example-site-theme \
 -DthemeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT

(cd example-site-theme; mvn install)
cd example-site-foo-webapp
mvn install
mvn jetty:run
----

Leave this window open. 
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8888[]. 
Edit xhtml in src/main/webapp and reload the page and see changes immediately.

If you wish to edit the theme as well, open another window, then:

 cd $HOME/example-site/example-site-theme
 mvn fizzed-watcher:run

Modify scss files, for example _example-site-theme/src/main/resources/scss/_settings.scss_.
Wait a few seconds for the recompile to finish and reload the page in the browser.


///// 
not ready yet
== Deployment for production 

To create a war file for Wildfly:

 cd streichelzoo-faces-template
 mvn -P wilfly clean verify install

The resulting war file is in the /target directory.
/////


== Note

To install latest Maven in Debian Jessie:

Add __deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ stretch main__ to /etc/apt/sources.list.

Add to /etc/apt/preferences:

----
Package: *
Pin: release n=stretch
Pin-Priority: 130

Package: maven
Pin: release n=stretch
Pin-Priority: 510

Package: libmaven*
Pin: release n=stretch
Pin-Priority: 510

Package: lib*java
Pin: release n=stretch
Pin-Priority: 510
----

Update and check:

 aptitude update
 apt-cache policy

Then install:

 aptitude install maven


////
== Note how to update version

To set a new version, specify a local property version per artifact and use this:

 mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.95-SNAPSHOT
 mvn versions:update-properties -DnewVersion=0.95-SNAPSHOT
