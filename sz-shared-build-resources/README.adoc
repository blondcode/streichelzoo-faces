= Streichelzoo Faces Maven Build Shared Resources

This module downloads foundation-sites sources from Github.
It then uses the just downloaded package.json to install 
nodejs and dependencies.

All downloaded sources then will be provided as a Maven shared
resource for use with artifact sz-base-cssjs, which builds all
css and js.
